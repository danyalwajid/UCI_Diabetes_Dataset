    "In this example, we will use a fully-connected network structure with three layers.\n",

    "In this case, we initialize the network weights to a small random number generated from a uniform distribution ('uniform'), in this case between 0 and 0.05 because that is the default uniform weight initialization in Keras. Another traditional alternative would be 'normal' for small random numbers generated from a Gaussian distribution.\n",

It used to be the case that sigmoid and tanh activation functions were preferred for all layers. These days, better performance is achieved using the rectifier activation function. We use a sigmoid on the output layer to ensure our network output is between 0 and 1 and easy to map to either a probability of class 1 or snap to a hard classification of either class with a default threshold of 0.5."
