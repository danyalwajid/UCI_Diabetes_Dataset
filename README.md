# Diabetes_Dataset_UCI

This is a standard machine learning dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository. It describes patient medical record data for Pima Indians and whether they had an onset of diabetes within five years.

Keras is a powerful easy-to-use Python library for developing and evaluating deep learning models.

It wraps the efficient numerical computation libraries Theano and TensorFlow and allows you to define and train neural network models in a few short lines of code.

Here we will create our first neural network model in Python using Keras. Letâ€™s get started.

Steps involved are:

Load Data...
Define Model...
Compile Model...
Fit Model...
Make Predictions...
